- 👋 Hi, I’m Carlos.
- 👀 I’m directing my career towards being a full stack developer.
- 🌱 I’ve spent the recent months learning Nodejs, React and Javascript. This is an app I created recently: https://video-rental-frontend-app.herokuapp.com/
- 💞️ Even though most of my professional experience is on .Net, I want to start working on Javascript projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: carlos.hernandezcoto@outlook.com
